Otherwise, you will need to either edit the file that maps the virtual hosts, or park the domain if using shared hosting.\r\n\r\nA easy check to see if the domain name is ready to be parked is to navigate to the domain and if the default wordpress site comes up, you are good to go.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThis is a wordpress plugin. Create a folder called domain-parking in your WordPress plugin directory and move all the files into that directory. Then activate the plugin. Go to settings in wp-admin to configure new domain names\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
